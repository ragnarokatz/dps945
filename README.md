## DPS945 - Web Programming - Modern Apps

This is the home page for the DPS945 course in the BSD program, and WEB525 in the CPA program.

> Students build upon foundations acquired in previous web programming courses to learn concepts and techniques for building modern applications. (more to come)

<br>

Coming into this course, we assume that you have knowledge of and experience in:
* JavaScript and enhancement technologies (e.g. JSX, TypeScript)
* Creating Node.js (with Express and MongoDB) apps and services on a web server
* Creating apps that run on devices (computer, smartphone) that an end user owns

In this DPS945 course, we build upon that knowledge. 

The course is offered to Seneca students, as well as students from <a href="https://www.baaa.dk/" target="_blank">Business Academy Aarhus</a> (BAA) in Denmark. It runs in the summer term. In odd-numbered years (e.g. 2019, 2021), Seneca students travel to Aarhus, and in even-numbered years (e.g. 2020, 2022), BAA students travel to Toronto. 

In the first part of the course, Seneca students build a web service that will be used in the second part of the course. Adding to the previously-acquired foundations, a number of techniques and technologies are combined to create a quality web service that is hosted on a scalable platform. 

In the second part of the course, students from both Seneca and BAA begin working together in person. Small groups develop a custom and new application that includes modern technologies, and uses the web service that was built by Seneca students in the first part of the course. This part of the course is a ten-day every-day commitment.
