## DPS945 - Web Programming - Modern Apps

This is the home page for the DPS945 course in the BSD program, and WEB525 in the CPA program.

> The web evolves over time, introducing new approaches, frameworks, and tooling. This course enables the student to acquire current knowledge and experience needed to build modern apps. While the topics will evolve over time, the enduring themes include a focus on end user apps, project-based work in small international and cross-cultural agile teams, and implementation of a defined range of current and modern web technologies. 

A distinct feature of the course is that is available to students who participate in the [Summer Exchange with Denmark's *Business Academy Aarhus (BAA)*](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/denmark). 

In the Summer 2019 version, the theme will be [progressive web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications). Seneca students will be in Toronto in July, and in Denmark in August. 

Coming into this course, we assume that you have knowledge of and experience in:
* JavaScript and complementary technologies 
* Creating Node.js (with Express and MongoDB) services on a web server
* Creating apps that run on devices (computer, smartphone) that an end user owns

In this DPS945 course, we build upon that knowledge. 

More generally, the course is offered to Seneca and BAA students. It runs in the summer term. In odd-numbered years (e.g. 2019, 2021), Seneca students travel to Aarhus, and in even-numbered years (e.g. 2020, 2022), BAA students travel to Toronto. 

In the first part of the course, in July, Seneca students build a web service that will be used in the second part of the course. Adding to the previously-acquired foundations, a number of techniques and technologies are combined to create a quality web service that is hosted on a scalable platform. 

In the second part of the course, in August, students from both Seneca and BAA begin working together in person. Small groups develop a custom and new application that includes modern technologies, and uses the web service that was built by Seneca students in the first part of the course. This part of the course is a ten-day every-day commitment.
