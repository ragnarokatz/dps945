### Get help with course work

From Peter McIntyre:

> I am obviously available during our course time slots on Monday and Thursday.  
>
> During the Monday class, I will have limited free time.  
>
> During the Thursday class, I will have substantial free time. Thursdays will be the best day to get one-on-one help from me.  
>
> I plan to have drop-in help time on Mondays and Wednesdays  from 2:25pm to 3:15pm, in my office (DB2081).  
>
> While I will be somewhat available by email at other times, I will prefer to be available for help during the days and times discussed above. I will not commit to being available 24×7.  
>
> This may become important to you if you are facing a Thursday evening deadline for the assignment submission, and you discover that you want my help evening. I will almost certainly not be available. Therefore, you will be on your own, but you still must practice academic honesty. If you anticipate that this practice will be a problem for you, then set your own assignment due date deadline to better match my availability - for example, the Tuesday or Wednesday just before the Thursday deadline.
