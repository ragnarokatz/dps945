## DPS945 Week 7 Notes

Week of August 12, in Aarhus, Denmark. 

<br>

### Topics

There are few new topics this week, because the teams will be working on their project. 

<br>

### Tuesday 13 August notes

One of the topics today is a *peer review*. This kind of task is frequently done in workplaces, and enables a team to get feedback on progress, share their design and thought process, and maybe get help on challenging issues. 

Team A will work with Team D.  
Team C will work with Team E.  
Team B will work with Torill and Peter. 

The plan is to do the following:
1.  One team will interview the other team for about 10 to 15 minutes
2. Each of the major features will be reviewed (the three core features and the one custom feature); use the work task and code checklist below 
3. Record the results in a paper or digital document
4. Then, switch around and repeat steps 1 to 3

Allow about a half-hour. Use the following as a checklist to review the progress of the other team's work. 

[Peer review checklist](peer-review-checklist.html)

The document can be edited. Click the first input field "(Team X review of Team Y progress)" and edit. Use tab (and shift-tab) to navigate to the next (or previous) input field. 

After completing the checklist, print to PDF, and email the PDF to Torill and Peter.

Another topic is authentication. Rafi Ungar is sharing the procedure and code that he created to handle login and token handling. It is a component that you can use in your app. The code is posted in the code repo.
