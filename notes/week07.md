## DPS945 Week 7 Notes

Week of August 12, in Aarhus, Denmark. 

<br>

### Topics

There are few new topics this week, because the teams will be working on their project. 

<br>

### Tuesday 13 August notes

One of the topics today is a *peer review*. This kind of task is frequently done in workplaces, and enables a team to get feedback on progress, share their design and thought process, and maybe get help on challenging issues. 

Team A will work with Team D.  
Team C will work with Team E.  
Team B will work with Torill and Peter. 

The plan is to do the following:
1.  One team will interview the other team for about 10 to 15 minutes
2. Each of the major features will be reviewed (the three core features and the one custom feature); use the work task and code checklist below 
3. Record the results in a paper or digital document
4. Then, switch around and repeat steps 1 to 3

Allow about a half-hour. Use the following as a checklist to review the progress of the other team's work. 

[Peer review checklist](pwa-peer-review-checklist.html)

The document can be edited. Click the first input field at the top, "name" and edit (e.g. "Team X review of Team Y progress"). Use tab (and shift-tab) to navigate to the next (or previous) input field. 

After completing the checklist, print to PDF, and email the PDF to Torill and Peter.

Another topic is authentication. Rafi Ungar is sharing the procedure and code that he created to handle login and token handling. It is a component that you can use in your app. The code is posted in the code repo.

### Wednesday 14 August notes

Two brief topic presentations today:

[Testing and quality assurance](pwa-aug-14-testing.pdf)

[Performance considerations](pwa-aug-14-performance.pdf)

<br>

### Friday 16 August notes

Today, each group will present their work. Here is a [link to the schedule](/schedule-detailed#fredag-friday-16-august). We will begin at 08:30, so Team A should be ready to go then. Sofie will attend, and Anders (teacher of Rasmus) will too for Team E's presentation. 

Each timeslot will be about 40 minutes in length. That should allow a few minutes setup and completion time between each team's presentation. 

Make sure that at least two team computers have the [Airtame](https://airtame.com/start) software, and that you have tested the system. 

Also, practice your team's presentation before delivering it on Friday morning. 

For each presentation, plan on the following:
* Presentation - each team member participates - total length will be about 10 minutes 
* Don't worry about creating a lengthy slide set - the presentation is brief, and we're more interested in your thoughts and words, and in a demonstration 
* Demonstrate the app, show some of the code
* Be prepared to answer questions about the app, the development process, and so on 
* As an audience member, be prepared to ask the presenting team questions 
* Be honest, don't hide problems or difficulties
* Talk about an example of a problem, and how it was resolved
