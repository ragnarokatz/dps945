## Localization, Internationalization

### Introduction

The MO:VES app is primarily for *content* delivery and presentation.

However, a part of the user interface - the app "shell" and pages that require user interaction (e.g. login) will need to be localized.

### Content design

We have already discussed our content design, that requires the content author to provide it in different languages. We should plan for Arabic as one of the languages, which is notable because it is rendered right-to-left, when compared to English and Danish, which are rendered left-to-right. 

[Simple example, right-to-left](rtl.html)

### Tips...

* Wikipedia can be used to get real text (not lorem ipsum)  
* Its left-side menu will show the translations available for that article
