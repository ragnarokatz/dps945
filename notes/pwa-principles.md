## PWA principles

This document will preview (for the Seneca students) and review (for the Aarhus students) the principles that make a Progressive Web App (PWA). 

<br>

### Resource material

### The principles

Here are the key principles, which will be briefly discussed in class, and then implemented in your project. 

1. Installable  
2. Can work offline (note about *progressive*)  
3. Fast loading, and fast during use

Other principles:
* Built with the *web technologies* that you already know
* Responsive
* Self updating (code and data)
* Discoverable (it's on the web), and works on a browser too
* Safe
