## Azure services introduction

As noted in class, we will attempt to use Azure services to host our apps. 

<br>

### Getting started

Seneca students have access to Azure services. 

> The following is based on the professor's understanding and interpretation of the *Azure for Students* offer.  
> More information, or changed information, may be posted after clarification and/or our experience in the coming weeks.

After activating your Azure account, you have access for one year. Before the year is up, you will be notified of the end date, and you can renew for another year if you are still a student at that time.

Of interest to us in this course, there are a number of services which are free (no cost) as long as the monthly usage is below a designated per-service limit. Initially, we anticipate using three (3) services:

**App Service - Compute**  
This will host our Node.js web services.  
We are permitted up to 10 of these web service apps.  
(More than 10? It starts to cost money.)

**Azure Cosmos DB - Database**  
This will host our persisted data.  
We are permitted up to 5GB storage.  
In-and-out traffic is limited to 400 "request units" (RU) per second.  
(More than 5GB? More than 400 RU? It starts to cost money.)

**Active Directory B2C - Identity**  
This will provide identity management and authentication.  
We are permitted up to 50,000 user accounts.  
(More than 50,000? It starts to cost money.)

Each student begins the one-year period with US$100 in Azure credits. It is the professor's understanding that this amount will pay for services that exceed the monthly permitted limits (until the amount is exhausted). In other words, if the monthly limits are NOT exceeded, then the usage is totally free.
