## DPS945 Week 1 Notes

The theme for the first week or more is to transition your success in previous web programming courses to the new topics in this course.

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/resources).

<br>

### Previous courses

In the previous web programming courses, you gained foundational knowledge and experience in a number of important topics. 

<br>

### This course

In this course, you will enhance your *web service* knowledge and experience, and learn *modern user/client app* topics and techniques (which are currently known as "progressive web apps"). 

As you know, the course is split into two parts:  
The *first part* runs in July in Toronto, Canada, and focuses on web services.  
The *second part* runs in August in Aarhus, Denmark, and focuses on modern apps. 

There is a project theme to the course. Students will work in assigned teams on a project that is intended to benefit society in general and the sponsor specifically. 

The weekly notes will be organized and delivered as a collection of topic-themed documents. This page - "week01" - will simply guide you throught the topics in sequence. 

<br>

### Topics

This week's topics include: 

[Welcome](welcome) to the DPS945 course

[Web services (re)introduction](intro-web-services)

[Building a web service](web-api-build-intro)

[This document](postman-intro) introduces you to Postman, and has how-to getting started info.

<br>

#### Reminder

We expect the student to do their work on a computer that runs macOS (Mac OS X), Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. 

If a student has a Windows 10 computer, then plan to install an environment that enables the installation of Linux.

> For Windows 10 computers, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store is an excellent solution.
