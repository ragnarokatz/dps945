## Project MO:VES

(Morocco Volunteer Emergency Service)

### About MO:VES

#### Background for the project:

The need for social development in Morocco is great. This is recognized by both national and international voluntary organizations. Many areas are stricken by a lack of facilities, poverty and lack of social mobility. A lot of volunteers are sent to Morocco each year, however, there is no service for the safety of the volunteers working in the country. 

#### Why the project is needed:

It is not acceptable that no safety is guaranteed to volunteers going to Morocco. Volunteers are in a particularly vulnerable position, as they do not know the area, language and laws of the land. They also might find it difficult to get in contact with the right organization or governmental body, when they are in need of help. 

#### What we want to do: 

Our intention is to be able to establish an emergency service, available for volunteers in Tangier, Morocco. The service will be open to any and all volunteers stationed in Tangier, Morocco, any day of the week. Many things can happen when stationed in a foreign country. You can be the victim of a crime, find yourself in a medical emergency, or happen to lose your paperwork or other documentation. It is crucial that there is a service-center ready to help at all hours in the day. The service will offer both counselling as well as practical assistance.

#### What we hope to achieve:

We want all volunteers to feel safe, and be safe, in the country that they are in. Of course we want the same for volunteers in Morocco. Being a volunteer should be a rewarding experience both for the volunteer, and those whom she/he will help. We cannot prevent that misfortunes will happen, but we can help with alleviating the problems that arise from these misfortunes.

### The project 

In this project, you will create and prepare a Progressive Web App for MO:VES. You can use the provided Wireframes (Mockup) or you can come up with your own User friendly design. However your focus is to make a functional prototype, and not focus on making a beautiful design. (The web texts will be provided as well, if not use placeholder text.) 

It is up to each group to decide which function(s) they focus on in this project. You can look at the [ITAS.IE website](https://www.itas.ie) to get inspiration and ideas for the MOV:ES website. Here are some inputs on which functions you can focus on:

Google translate button (look at [itas.ie](https://www.itas.ie) header) 

Location with Google maps (help with finding your way to important locations, for example hospital, police and more) 

Button (call to action button) for emergency calls  

Push notification - if something important happens in the area, then the volunteers will know 

Leave a message for MO:VES (or chat with MO:VES) - Background Sync. 

#### Technical minimum requirements:

* The app should be installable 
* Service Worker has to register and at least catch fetch events (preferably more)
* There has to be a deliberate caching strategy that you can explain
* The app should be user-friendly and easy to use even when stressed
* Performance is important for PWAs – it should at least have over 80% on Lighthouse
