## MO:VES Project notes as of July 12

This document is the first that begins to define the specifications of the project. 

As we know, there will be two parts to the project:
1. Web service, hosted 
2. User app, typically for a smartphone

Our goal here in Toronto in July is to create the web service. 

However, we can also begin preparations for creating the user app.
