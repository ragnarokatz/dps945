## MO:VES Project Introduction

This document is the first that begins to define the specifications of the project. 

As we know, there will be two parts to the project:
1. Web service, hosted 
2. User app, typically for a smartphone

Our goal here in Toronto in July is to create the web service. 

However, we can also begin preparations for creating the user app.

### Project description

This linked project description was based on the ask and information from the client or sponsor:

We have also prepared some background information:

Here are links to ICVA client/sponsor web site:

### Orientation, getting familiar 

From the document, extract and note the goals, features, functionality, and so on. Remember, our primary goal in July is to create the web service, so make sure that you focus on that (but you still can consider the user app's needs).

Take some time to visit the web sites, and go through the content for ideas, inspiration, and scope.

### Initial goals for the web service 

Take some time to list them, and then gather into categories. Contemplate the data needed, its forms, and so on. 

One of the important characteristics of the user app is that it will mostly work offline (i.e. without a cellular or wifi network connection). As a result, think of the data in this context. You will learn about local storage for a user app soon, and techniques to synchronize data on devices with a shared web service. 

This will be done partly as an individual, paired, or small team task. Then we will all get together and share the results. The professor will document that part (although you are still expected to make your own notes).
