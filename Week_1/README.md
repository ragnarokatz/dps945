## Week 1 code examples

All code examples on this repository are missing the `node_modules` folder. Why? To reduce the size, and maintain the fast speed of the repository download. (Each app's `node_modules` folder often has 200MB to 300MB of content, so the total repository download size can quickly add up to a big number.)

The `node_modules` folder can be easily re-created on your computer. Run this command while in the directory/folder that has the `package.json` file:

```
npm i
```
