#### Midttraffik is the local transit operator

It appears that the best value for transit is to purchase a multi trip ticket (10 charges). This results in a per-trip charge of 17 DKK (which is about C$3.40). 

Get the [Midttraffik app](https://www.midttrafik.dk/english/tickets/midttrafik-app/). 

After installation, set up an account. Pay by credit card. 

Just before boarding a train, open the app, and "use" one of the tickets. 

> No multi trip ticket?  
> The per-ticket cost rises to 22 DKK (which is about C$4.40).  
> Can buy these at machines apparently (before boarding).
